			<p>Born and raised in New York City, Susannah Church loves the always enthusiastic and anticipatory buzz around Halligan's halls. Only finding her true love for Computer Science during her sophomore year, Susannah has done all she can to immerse herself in the field. After taking Comp 11 and Comp 15, she got some practical programming experience working at Altisource Labs this summer, a mortgage-servicing software start-up in Boston.</p>
			<p>When not debugging code, Susannah enjoys singing with her all-female acapella group (girl power!) and trying new and interesting foods to write about for Tufts' food blog. She is excited for all of the new and useful knowledge she will gain from Comp 20, and hopes she will enjoy the rest of the semester as much as she has so far!</p>

First Website

I had a lot of fun writing this website. I believe that I implemented all of the specs correctly, using a considerable amount more of CSS than was originally specified. The only person I've asked questions to was Nate Winters, a former Comp 20 student, on some HTML syntax (why doesn't my list look nice? because I'm not using the <ul> tags). I think all in all, this assignment took me about three hours. To be honest, the most trouble I had was getting git to display the website on http://schurc01.github.io. 

In the future, it will be nice to use other CSS files so that I can incorporate some more diverse fonts, as well as use tools like AngularJS to give more dimensions to my webpage. This was a great project idea and, with a little sprucing, useful for future career endeavors.
